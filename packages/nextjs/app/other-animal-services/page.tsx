                Dr. Edward Bach, a renowned physician concluded almost 80 years ago that his patients' illnesses were
                directly related to their negative states of mind. Flower Essences are dilute infusions of flowers and
                tree buds that can improve the mental state which subsequently influences the physical state. They
                simply replace the negative trait with its positive virtue. Flower Essences are totally safe,
                non-addictive, holistic, and completely compatible with conventional and homeopathic medicine.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Flower Essences help animals with issues such as aggression, fear, depression, lack of confidence,
                separation anxiety, hyperactivity, and concentration issues. Essences can be especially helpful for
                emotional issues during or after a traumatic experience such as: thunderstorms, car rides, aggressive
                encounter with another animal, loss of another pet in the family, injuries, surgery, etc.

                Reiki is a Japanese healing technique based on the principle that the therapist can channel energy into
                the patient by means of touch, to activate the natural healing processes of the patient's body and
                restore physical and emotional well-being. They do this by moving the 'Rei' or 'life force energy' to
                parts of the body, meridians, or chakras that are unbalanced.

              <p className="mb-4">
                "Reiki is an ideal alternative therapy for animals because it is gentle, painless, non-invasive and
                stress free. It heals at all levels of an animal's being: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. It
                can be given at any distance, under any circumstances to treat any problem. It is a powerful holistic
                therapy that always goes to the root of the problem, but causes no harm to recipient or practitioner." â€“

                  This can be done over distance. It can be performed over Zoom or using a picture. It depends on how
                  long your animal needs healing. Typically 30-45 minutes, but will go as long as 1 hour.

                  Due to the animal-human bond, many owners present with similar emotional imbalances as their pet as
                  they live in the same environment. Combination sessions allow me to work on both you and your animal

              <p className="mb-4">
                Animal communication is a form of telepathy that allows one to have a 'conversation' with an animal.
                Telepathy is the ability to see what is in someone else's mind, to feel their feelings, or to
                communicate mentally. Many animal communicators also connect with animals that have passed away or are
                lost as this therapy is not limited by time or distance.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                An animal communication session helps you to gain a deeper understanding of your animal and help them
                feel heard. It is commonly used to determine why a behavioural problem occurred, how the animal feels
                physically or about changes, food choices, their routine, travelling, surgery, or death, etc.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                To do a session, all I need is a picture of your animal looking at the camera that doesn't have any
                other people or animals in it, your animal's name, age, and gender. Many pet parents also provide a list
                of specific questions or concerns going into the session and those are discussed with the animal.
